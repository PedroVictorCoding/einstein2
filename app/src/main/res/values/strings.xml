    <string name="what_is_philosophy_article">When people ask me what philosophy is about I tend to use this analogy, philosophy is the soil in a beautiful garden, where trees are subjects like chemistry and physics that is everything that exists - I am pretty sure that someone used that analogy before - everything that is not science yet, all the questions that we do not have data or information about, but that still have great importance, and a significant meaning behind it, a scientist with an open mind is a philosopher, for that reason philosophy should be a full-time job, because it develops a critical thinking and a constant need for discussion. When I try to explain what philosophy is about I typically say this: Philosophy means the love for knowledge, we should have that as a standard. Plato collects Socrates speeches in the "Apology" were you can find the infamous quote "the unexamined life is not worth living," he stated that when he choose dying over Athens (his home) or committing to silence, we should make our life about being better even if life strives to limit you, but that will be discussed later in a different chapter. </string>
